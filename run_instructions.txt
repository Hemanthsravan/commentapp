In commentapp folder..we have the following folders
1.templates-which contains all the html files
2.static- this is for css desgning of html files
3.commentapp.py

We need a MySQL WorkBench for verifying user signup and signin details under "commentapp" table in "sravandb" database

In any of the code editors- place the commentapp.py
Run Apache and MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel
After running the code, we can verify whether user details are getting inserted in the backend with comment app table in sravandb database
login into the urls provided in the code to check the web pages redirecting into the respective pages
